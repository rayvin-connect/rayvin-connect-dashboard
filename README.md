### Rayvin Connect Dashboard

This is an example React application that demonstrates using [Rayvin Connect](https://github.com/rayvin-connect/rayvin-connect) to build a web dashboard that displays real-time listings from the NBA Top Shot marketplace.

You can use this as a starting point to build your own dashboard that helps you show listings that are of interest to you using any criteria you can think of.
